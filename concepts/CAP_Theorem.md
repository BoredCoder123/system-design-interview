# CAP Theorem

## Concepts
- A distributed computer system can only support 2 of the 3 guarantees:
   - **Consistency**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
   - **Availability**: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
   - **Partition tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.
