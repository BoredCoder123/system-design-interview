### More topics will be added
- Build a real-time gaming leaderboardboard (System design interview vol2)
- Build a currency exchange system
- Build a traffic control system
  - Requirements
     - A group of traffic lights has two components: main lights and pedestrian lights.
     - Main traffic lights have three colors: red, yellow and green.
     - Pedestrian lights have two colors: red and green.
     - Pedestrian lights' colors are reversed from main lights:
        - Main: red/yellow - pedestrian's: green
        - Main: green - pedestrian: red
     - There is a button for pedestrian lights if the button is pushed in advance, pedestrian's lights change colors according to the main ones if the button isn't pushed, pedestrian's lights remain red.
     - A typical junction has 4 groups of lights.
     - Additional question: design the system in a way that allows cars which start from one junction after a red light don't have to stop at the next one.
  - Key points in solution
     - Cnosider all phase transitions (from red to green, red to orange to green, and so on)
     - Be clear on the conditions in which a certain transition will take place
     - Consider pedestrian crossing requirements
     - Determine cycle length
     - Determine clearance time
     - Apportion green light approriately
- Build a counter system for online services
- Build a game of chess
- Build a parking garage
- Build an online bookstore
