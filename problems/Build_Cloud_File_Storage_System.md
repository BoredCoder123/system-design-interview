# Build Cloud File Storage System

## Real-life examples
- Google Drive
- Microsoft OneDrive
- Dropbox

## Requirements clarification
- **Functional requirements**
   - Upload and download: Users can upload and download files.
   - Share: Users can share their files with other users.
- **Non-functional requirements**
   - High availability (Users can access their files whenever and wherever they like).
   - High reliability (Any file uploaded should not be lost).
   - High consistency is desirable (It should be ok for a user doesnâ€™t see a file for a while).

## Estimation
- **Traffic estimation**
   - Our system will have huge read and write volumes.
   - Read-write ratio is expected to be nearly the same.
   - Users
      - 500 million users. (Assumed)
      - 100 million daily active users. (Assumed)
   - Files
      - Each user has 200 files. (Assumed)
      - Average file size = 100 KB (Assumed)
- **Storage estimation**
   - Total capacity needed = Number of total users x Number of files per user x Average file size = 500 million x 200 x 100 KB = 10 PB
- **Bandwidth estimation**

## System interface definition

## Data model definition

## High-level design

- **Block Server**
   - Handle upload/download file operations
   - Update the file metadata to the metadata database after uploading files.
- **Metadata Server**
   - Handle file search operation.
- **Synchronization Servers**
   - Get file updates from clients.
   - Sychronize file updates to clients.
- **Message Queue**
   - Request Queue
   - Response Queue
