# Build Video Distribution System

## Real-life Examples
- Youtube
- Netflix
- Vimeo

## Requirements Clarification
- **Functional requirements**
   - Upload video: Users can upload videos.
   - Watch video: Users can watch videos.
   - Search video: Users can search videos.
   - Comment video: Users can leave comments to videos, also like or dislike.
- **Non-functional requirements**
   - High reliability (any video uploaded should not be lost).
   - High availability.
   - High consistency is desirable (It should be ok for a user doesnâ€™t see a video for a while).

## High-level design
