# Build Payment System

## Real-life examples
- **Digital wallet**
   - Apple Pay
   - Google Pay
- **Online payment platform**
   - PayPal
   - Stripe
   - Square

## Concepts
- **Payment options**
   - Credit/Debit cards
      - Card network: Visa, MasterCard
         - POS terminal / Online
         - Contact / Contactless (NFC)
      - Online payment platform (PayPal, Stripe, Square)
      - Digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
      - Direct debit (This method allows authorized parties to directly withdraw funds from a customer's bank account, often used for recurring payments like utility bills).
      - Checks / Money orders
- **Payment Service Provider (PSP) / Payment processors / Payment gateway**
   - A third-party company that allows businesses to accept electronic payments, such as credit cards and debit cards payments.

## Requirements clarification
- **Functional requirements**
   - Support money movement for an e-commerce application:
      - Pay-in flow: Receive money from customers on behalf of sellers once customers place orders.
      - Pay-out flow: Send money to sellers once the products are delivered and money is released.

   - The payment system should support all the payment options
   - Use third-party payment processors (Paypal, Stripe, Square, Braintree, Adyen, Galileo, etc.) for credit card payment processing.
- **Non-functional requirements**
   - Fault tolerance (Failed payments need to be handled carefully).
   - A reconciliation process between internal services (payment services, accounting services, etc.) and external services (payment service providers, etc.)
      - When a service fails, different services may run into inconsistent states. So we need to execute the reconciliation process to fix any inconsistent payment information among all services.

- **Traffic estimation**
- **Storage estimation**
- **Bandwidth estimation**

## System interface definition
- **POST** `/v1/payments`
   - Function: Execute a payment event.
   - Request body
     ```json
     {
       "buyer_info" : {},
       "checkout_id" : "",
       "credit_card_info" : {},
       "payment_orders": [
         {
           "seller_account" : "",
           "amount" : "",
           "currency" : "",
           "payment_order_id": ""
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Notes
      - `payment_order_id`: It is userd by the PSP as the deduplication ID, also called the idempotency key/token.
      - `amount`: The type of this field is string, not double.
- **GET** `/v1/payments/{:id}`
   - Function: Get the execution status of a single payment order.

## Data model definition
- **Schema**
   - Table 1: Payment event
      - Description
         - Stores detailed payment event inforamtion.
      - Columns
        | Column Name | Column Type | PK/FK | Description |
        |----|----|----|----|
        | checkout_id | string | PK | |
        | buyer_info | string | | |
        | seller_info | string | | |
        | credit_card_info | string | | |
        | is_payment_done | boolean | | |
        
   - Table 2: Payment order
      - Description
         - Stores the execution status of each payment order.
      - Columns
        | Column Name | Column Type | PK/FK | Description |
        |----|----|----|----|
        | payment_order_id | string | PK | |
        | buyer_account | string | | |
        | amount | string | | |
        | currency | string | | |
        | checkout_id | string | FK | The foreign key to the payment event table's `checkout_id`. |
        | payment_order_status | string | | The status of the payment order. The value can be: <ul><li>`NOT_STARTED`<li>`EXECUTING`<li>`SUCCESS`<li>`FAILED`</ul> |
        | ledger_updated | boolean | | |
        | wallet_updated | boolean | | |

- **Components**
   - Payment service
      - Accepts payment events (one event may contain multiple payment orders) from users and coordinates the payment process.
   - Payment executor
      - Executes a single payment order via a Payment Service Provider (PSP).
   - Payment Service Provider (PSP)
      - Moves money from one account to another.
   - Card schemas
      - The organizations that process credit card operations.
   - Ledger
      - Stores transaction history.
   - Wallet
      - Stores accounts' balances.
   - Reconciliation
      - Parses the settlement file and compare it with the ledage system.
- **Processes**
   - Process after a user clicks the "place order" button:
      - (1) A payment event is generated and sent to the payment service.
      - (2) The payment service stores the payment event in the database.
      - (3) The payment service sends a payment order to the payment executor.
      - (4) The payment executor stores the payment order in the database.
      - (5) The payment executor calls an external PSP to process the credit card payment.
      - (6) After the payment executor has successfully executed the payment, the payment service will update the wallet to record how much money a given seller has.
      - (7) The wallet server stores the updated balance information in the database.
      - (8) After the wallet service has successfully updated the sellerâ€™s balance information, the payment service will call the ledger to save the transaction history.
      - (9) The ledger service adds the new transaction history to the database.
      - (10) The reconciliation system parses the settlement file and compare it with the ledage system.
- **Notes**
   - Payment event and payment order
      - A payment event may contain several payment orders.
      - A user may select multiple products from multiple sellers in a single checkout process. The system splits the checkout into multiple payment orders.
   - Settlement file
      - Every night the PSP or banks send a settlement file to their clients.
      - Contains the balance of the bank account, together with all the transactions that took place on this bank account during the day.
