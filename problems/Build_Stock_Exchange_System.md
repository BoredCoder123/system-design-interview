   - Only support trading stock.
- **Non-functional requirements**
   - *High availability*
      - Availability is crucial for exchanges
   - *Fault tolerance*
      - Fault tolerance and a fast recovery mechanism are needed to limit the impact of a production incident.
   - *Low latency*
      - The round-trip latency should be at the millisecond level.
   - *High security*
      - Verify a userâ€™s identity before a new account is opened.
