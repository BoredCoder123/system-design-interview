# Build Hotel Reservation System

## Real-life examples
- Airbnb
- Priceline
- Booking.com

## Requirements clarification
- **Functional requirements**
   - Users can search hotels.
   - Users can see detailed pages about hotels and rooms.
   - Users can reserve a room.
   - Hotel owners can use admin portal to add/remove/update hotel or room info.
- **Non-functional requirements**
   - *High concurrency*
      - During peak season or big events, some popular hotels may have a lot of customers trying to book the same room.
   - *Moderate latency*
      - Itâ€™s acceptable if the system takes a few seconds to process a reservation request.
